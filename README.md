# Betsson

## Build Steps

- @ngrx/store
- @angular/material
- @ngrx/store-devtools
- @lazysizes (a fast (jank-free), SEO-friendly and self-initializing lazyloader for images ["Lazysizes" Github](https://github.com/afarkas/lazysizes))

** Decisions **

- Decided to remove the details on the coverpage to give more space to the image and when you click you will see details anyway.
- ** Missing **

- absolute style imports
- change movies per column during filter if it drops below 5
- extract the input filter from the movies component
- indicator that the list is currently being filtered
